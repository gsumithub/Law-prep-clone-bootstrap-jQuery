# Law Prep Website Clone (Frontend)

This project is a **frontend clone of a large-scale, production-level educational website**, built with the primary goal of **mastering real-world UI development using Bootstrap and JavaScript**.

Instead of working on small demo components, I intentionally chose a **massive, content-heavy webpage** to understand how complex layouts, responsiveness, and interactions are handled in real industry websites.

## 🎯 What I Focused On

### 🔹 Bootstrap Mastery
- Implemented **complex grid systems** (nested rows, asymmetric layouts)
- Handled **odd column distributions** and non-standard layouts
- Used Bootstrap utility classes effectively instead of excessive custom CSS

### 🔹 Advanced Responsiveness
- Fully responsive across **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**
- Implemented **layout switching** (grid → carousel) based on screen size
- Fixed overflow, alignment, and spacing issues across breakpoints

### 🔹 JavaScript & jQuery
- Used **JavaScript** for UI logic and interactivity
- Integrated **jQuery** for DOM manipulation and plugin handling
- Implemented multiple **Owl Carousel** sliders with proper structure, autoplay, and responsiveness

### 🔹 UI Components & Interactions
- FAQ section using **Bootstrap Accordion**
- Video modals with controlled width and height
- Card-based layouts with consistent spacing and hierarchy
- Forms structured for validation and scalability

### 🔹 Performance & Code Quality
- Audited the page using **Google Lighthouse**
- Focused on:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Clean DOM structure
  - Reusable components
  - Reduced layout shifts and unnecessary nesting

## 🧠 Extra Challenge
Along with cloning this already complex webpage, I also **implemented a complex design pattern inspired by another website**, combining multiple design approaches into a single cohesive layout.  
This reflects real-world scenarios where developers adapt and merge designs across projects.

## 📌 Purpose of This Project
This project was built **purely for learning and skill enhancement**.  
It demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze real-world websites
- Break down complex UIs
- Rebuild them cleanly using frontend fundamentals
- Debug responsiveness and layout issues systematically

## 📂 Notes
More refactoring and improvements may be added as I continue learning.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
